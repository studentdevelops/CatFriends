An App made with React and AJAX, where u can find the cat that you will love to adapt

It will display the name of the cat and the contact details of the owner for adoption purpose.


How does it work?
The App uses react hooks to store the required states.
The names, contact details and image is fetched from jsonplaceholder and images are fetched from Robohash.org
